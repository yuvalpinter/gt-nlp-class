These notes are the basis for the readings in CS4650 and CS7650 ("Natural Language") at Georgia Tech.

- For Spring 2018, all CS4650/7650 readings are from [eisenstein-nlp-notes-jan-10-2018.pdf](eisenstein-nlp-notes-jan-10-2018.pdf) unless otherwise indicated in the schedule. 
- The latest version is [eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf](eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf). A few chapters will be updated during the semester, and this will be noted in the schedule.

You are welcome to use these notes and slides for your own learning or teaching, assuming you give attribution. If you do use this material in your another class, please tell me! Feedback of any kind is welcome. You can reach me directly at jacobe gatech edu.
