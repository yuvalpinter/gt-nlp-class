**Deliverable 3.8** (7650 only; 4650 optional)

To match nominals, it is often necessary to capture semantics. Find a paper (in ACL, NAACL, EACL, or TACL, since 2007) that attempts to use semantic analysis to do nominal coreference, and explain:

- What form of semantics they are trying to capture (e.g., synonymy, hypernymy, predicate-argument, distributional)
- How they formalize semantics into features, constraints, or some other preference
- How much it helps
